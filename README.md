### Course Information Flow and A Note On Contacting The Instructor:
This courses primarily uses Canvas to manage information flow.
It will be used for announcements, lecture notes, assignments, and possibly for submitting work (details provided later).
The Canvas link is https://umich.instructure.com/courses/173857.
The instructor’s course website is primarily the public portal to the site for broad reach in what the course covers, it will not be updated regularly throughout the term.
Piazza will be used for discussions.
Nearly all questions you have about the course, both logistical and technical should be posted to piazza.
Only in the event of a concern of privacy, should you directly email the instructor.
We also use Nota Bene (NB) for week-to-week readings and idea exchange.
More details are below.
** Students are expected to help each other through postings and discussions on the Canvas, Piazza and NB site. In fact, some of
this is factored into your grade. **
